## The Request/Response Cycle of the Web

![Web Request/Response Cycle Diagram](/images/wrrc.png)

## Overview
Building a server to listen for request from frontend app.

## Getting Started
To get started you will need to npm install express, dotenv, and cors to app folder. Add .gitignore and .eslintrc.json file.
Add .env file and put .env in .gitignore content space.

## Architecture

[Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/):As an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications.

[NPM JS](https://docs.npmjs.com/):Use to help share and borrow packages.

[Express JS](http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html): A web frameork for Node.js

[NPM JS package:dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv): Storing configuration in the environment separate from the code base.

[NPM JS package:cors](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/cors.html):Allow REACT app forntend to access data form server

[NPM JS package:axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-axios):This is intended to allow in render async requests.

[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home): Used to up load server app.

[Trello:project board](https://trello.com/en-US):Help manage projects.

## The Request/Response Cycle of the Web

![Request/Response Cycle of the Web Diagram](/images/wrrc2.png)

## Overview
Requesting data from my server to get data from third API Weatherbit and Themoviedb. Then render data to frontend.

## Getting Started
1. You will need to to get your own API key from [Weatherbit](https://www.weatherbit.io/) and [Themoviedb](https://www.themoviedb.org/)

2. Add an .env file. Next add (.env) to your .gitignore file to hide API keys

3. On your terminal you need to install dependencies: axios, cors, dotenv, express and superagent.

<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->

## Credit and Collaborations
- Work with Michael Hendricks, Prabin Singh and Tom McGuire to figure about how to  request and response data from api.

- Lecture and Instruction with Michelle Ferreirae and Ryan Gallaway

- Assists from Joe Pennock
