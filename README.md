![Web Request/Response Cycle Diagram](/images/wrrc.png)

## Overview
Building a server to listen for request from frontend app.

## Getting Started
To get started you will need to npm install express, dotenv, and cors to app folder. Add .gitignore and .eslintrc.json file.
Add .env file and put .env in .gitignore content space.

## Architecture

[Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/):As an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications.

[NPM JS](https://docs.npmjs.com/):Use to help share and borrow packages.

[Express JS](http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html): A web frameork for Node.js

[NPM JS package:dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv): Storing configuration in the environment separate from the code base.

[NPM JS package:cors](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/cors.html):Allow REACT app forntend to access data form server

[NPM JS package:axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-axios):This is intended to allow in render async requests.

[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home): Used to up load server app.
