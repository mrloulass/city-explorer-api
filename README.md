## The Request/Response Cycle of the Web

![Web Request/Response Cycle Diagram](/img/wrrc.png)

## Overview
Building a server to listen for request from frontend app.

## Getting Started
To get started you will need to npm install express, dotenv, and cors to app folder. Add .gitignore and .eslintrc.json file.
Add .env file and put .env in .gitignore content space.

## Architecture

[Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/):As an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications.

[NPM JS](https://docs.npmjs.com/):Use to help share and borrow packages.

[Express JS](http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html): A web frameork for Node.js

[NPM JS package:dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv): Storing configuration in the environment separate from the code base.

[NPM JS package:cors](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/cors.html):Allow REACT app forntend to access data form server

[NPM JS package:axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-axios):This is intended to allow in render async requests.

## The Request/Response Cycle of the Web

![Request/Response Cycle of the Web Diagram](/img/wrrc2.png)

## Overview
Requesting data from my server to get data from third API Weatherbit and Themoviedb. Then render data to frontend.

## Getting Started
1. You will need to to get your own API key from [Weatherbit](https://www.weatherbit.io/) and [Themoviedb](https://www.themoviedb.org/)

2. Add an .env file. Next add (.env) to your .gitignore file to hide API keys

3. On your terminal you need to install dependencies: axios, cors, dotenv, express and superagent.

## The Request/Response Cycle of the Web

![Request/Response Cycle of the Web Diagram](/img/WRRC3.png)

## Overview

Refactor code: Modularize the back-end codebase

## Getting Started

1. Remove the weather functionality from the `server.js` and place it in its own `weather.js` file. Bring that component into your `server.js` file and ensure that your server is functioning as expected before moving on.

2. Remove the movie functionality from the `server.js` and place it in its own `movies.js` file. Bring that component into your `server.js` file and ensure that your server is functioning as expected before moving on.

3. Deploy your changes to website.

## The Request/Response Cycle of the Web

![Request/Response Cycle of the Web Diagram](/img/wrrc-04.png)

## Overview

I'm adding Cache to my server so that I can see info without the app doing unnecessary API calls.

## Getting Started

1. Require in to your server.js a global object variable. to act as a place to store values that persist beyond individual request-response cycles. This type of server "memory" is referred to as a "cache".

2. Check the cache for a recent API result for the value specified

3. Use **If** statement if recent result is already stored in memory console.log("cache hit"), return that result, without querying the API again.

**else** if no recent result is found console.log("cache miss"), query the API for a fresh result, add it to server memory with the time of retrieval, and return the fresh result.

4. Choose an appropriate definition of "recent", the timespan beyond which you deem the data to be stale, and in need of updating ("cache invalidation").
